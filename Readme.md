# Description

Example project like simulation simulation platform where users can log in and interact with fake simulated people via chatbots to see what they say to the fake people. This project contructed by actor model.  Our approach will have an actor that accepts a chat log and caches it under an ID. We then have another actor that periodically gets message data from the cache actor and sends it to another server.
